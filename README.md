# Rubik's Cube Solver

## Description

**Rubik's cube solver** with the aim to **aid learning** a manual **blindfolded solving**.

The cube itself is **represented using a simple 3D array** form because simplicity is paramount. There is **no need for efficient algorithm execution** (hence the relatively trivial representation). The objective is to develop a simple yet **fast assistant that can verify whether a given sequence of moves is valid** by yielding an expected outcome.
